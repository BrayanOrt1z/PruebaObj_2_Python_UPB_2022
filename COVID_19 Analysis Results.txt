Based on the information provided by the graphs and tables above, we can conclude the following:

The growth of COVID_19 was exponentially which tells us that the transmission of the virus was very fast and besides that, any person of any age can easily contract it. We can also notice that the data are scattered. This shows that there were days, weeks or even months in which the level of affection was quite critical, which demonstrates that Covid_19 is a virus with pandemic potential and quite deadly for the population. In addition, we can also see that in some regions of the world, COVID_19 had a greater impact. Examples of this are the regions of America and Europe. The causes of these regions where the virus had a greater impact may be due to the fact that the preventive sanitary measures were not rigorous enough or it was due to negligence and lack of awareness of the population, since social awareness is fundamental because one has to know that preventive measures are not only taken to take care of oneself, but also to protect others.
